# PDF Viewer and Acroform editor

This is an example of usage of the pdf.js library.
More precisely, an usage of acroform functionality.

There is currently a big lack of documentation on the subject.

Moreover, I have written some functions to:
* read the content of the form
* write value in the form
* save/download the form with the current form values
